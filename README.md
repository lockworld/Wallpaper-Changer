# Wallpaper-Changer
Originally created to manually change the desktop wallpaper for Windows XP, this script was later modified to work with Windows 7+.

This is the old (outdated) script originally written for Windows XP (though it worked only with Windows XP Home) and tweaked over the years. This version is not compatible with Windows 7+.
