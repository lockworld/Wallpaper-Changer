# Wallpaper-Changer
Originally created to manually change the desktop wallpaper for Windows XP, this script was later modified to work with Windows 7+.

This script is not currently functional. The original script included an HTA application that allowed the user to set a custom source and destination directory for background images, as well as scaling properties and the number of images to keep. These properties need to be set manually in the Settings file for now.
